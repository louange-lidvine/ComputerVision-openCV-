# OpenCV Image Processing Assignment

This repository contains Python code using OpenCV to perform basic image processing tasks, such as reading an image, drawing shapes, adding text, and saving the result. It includes an example of how to draw a rectangle on an image, overlay text, and apply a shadow effect behind the text.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python` or `opencv-python-headless`)
- Matplotlib (optional for displaying images in headless environments)

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib  # For headless environments
